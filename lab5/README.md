# Part 5. Working with Aurora Serverless

## Task 5.1 Run CloudFormation Stack to create Cloud 9 IDE

S3 URL for Cloud Formation Template :

[https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-cloud9-ide/templates/cloud9-ide-instance.yaml](https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-cloud9-ide/templates/cloud9-ide-instance.yaml)

You will need to have public subnet id from the previous cloudformation template outputs section handy for this step.

[https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2 - /stacks/create/template?stackName=AWS-Cloud9-IDE&amp;templateURL=https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-cloud9-ide/templates/cloud9-ide-instance.yaml](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/create/template?stackName=AWS-Cloud9-IDE&amp;templateURL=https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-cloud9-ide/templates/cloud9-ide-instance.yaml)

You can do this using the Query Editor on the console or any mysql client . Note the Query editor is currently

only available for Aurora Serverless MYSQL

Navigate to the RDS Console and click on the Query Editor option on the left pane.

On the following screen please select the following for the fields.
